# MultilayerPerceptronClassification

This is an Eclipse project of a multilayer perceptron for classification problems coded in C++. You can use Eclipse, or any other code editor, in order to read the code or even make changes.

In the PDF file you will find the structure and the algorithms that were used in the project explained in detail, although is only in Spanish. I will translate it as soon as i can :)
